              <p>We have worked hard to optimized minecraft so it's can handle more than your average server, by mutli threading technology.</p>
              <h4>Custom Plugins</h4>
              <p>We are very sick of the same old faction servers, so all the plugins we have is custom that you can't get anywhere else.</p>

              <h4>Improved Combat</h4>
              <p>We have a modified the minecraft server, so that combat is more fluid, your hits are more reliable and smooth.</p>
              <h4>Statistics</h4>
              <p>We record as many Statistics as possible from number of kills you get, to who you killed in the last 5 minutes with what weapon</p>
